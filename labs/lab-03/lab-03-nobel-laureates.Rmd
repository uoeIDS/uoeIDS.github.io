In January 2017, BuzzFeed News published an article on why Nobel laureates show immigration is so important for American science.
You can read the article [here](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science).
In the article, they show that while most living Nobel laureates in the sciences are based in the US, many of them were born in other countries.
This is one reason why scientific leaders say that immigration is vital for progress.
In this lab, we will work with the data from this article to recreate some of their visualizations as well as explore new questions.

# Learning goals

-   Manipulate and transform data to prepare it for visualization.
-   Recreate visualizations.
-   Summarise data.
-   Get more practice working as a team.

# Workshop prep

You have two tasks you should complete before the workshop:

-   **Task 1:** Read the BuzzFeed News article titled [*These Nobel Prize Winners Show Why Immigration Is So Important For American Science*](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science)*.* We will replicate this analysis in the workshop so it is crucial that you are familiar with it ahead of time.
-   **Task 2:** Read about merge conflicts below. The merge conflict exercise we will start with during the workshop will assume that you have this background information.

## Merges and merge conflicts

You should by now have a bit of experience with Git and Github, and so now let us deliberately make a merge conflict so we can have more practice fixing them.

-   Pushing to a repo replaces the code on GitHub with the code you have on your computer.
-   If a collaborator has made a change to your repo on GitHub that you have not incorporated into your local work, GitHub will stop you from pushing to the repo because this could overwrite your collaborator's work!
-   So you need to explicitly "merge" your collaborator's work before you can push.
-   If you and your collaborator's changes are in different files or in different parts of the same file, git merges the work for you automatically when you *pull*.
-   If you both changed the same part of a file, git will produce a **merge conflict** because it does not know how which change you want to keep and which change you want to overwrite.

Git will put conflict markers in your code that look like:

    <<<<<<< HEAD 

    See also: [dplyr documentation](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)   

    ======= 

    See also [ggplot2 documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)  

    >>>>>>> some1alpha2numeric3string4

The `===`s separate *your* changes (top) from *their* changes (bottom).

Note that on top you see the word `HEAD`, which indicates that these are your changes.

And at the bottom you see `some1alpha2numeric3string4` (well, it probably looks more like `28e7b2ceb39972085a0860892062810fb812a08f`).

This is the **hash** (a unique identifier) of the commit your collaborator made with the conflicting change.

Your job is to *reconcile* the changes: edit the file so that it incorporates the best of both versions and delete the `<<<`, `===`, and `>>>` lines.
Then you can stage and commit the result.

Complete the following steps during the live workshop with your team.

# Merge conflict activity

## Setup

-   Find your workshop group and assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of the team members (ideally different numbers than last week). If your team has fewer than 4 people, some people will need to have multiple numbers.
-   Team member 1 needs to clone the lab's template repository from [https://github.com/uoeIDS/lab-03-template](https://github.com/uoeIDS/lab-03-template) and add the other team members as collaborators.
-   All team members will need to create a new R version control project using the GitHub repository created by team member 1.

## Let's cause a merge conflict!

Our goal is to see two different types of merges: first, we will see a type of merge where git cannot figure out what to do on its own (a **merge conflict**) and requires human intervention, then we will see another type of merge where git can figure out what to do without human intervention.

Doing this will require some tight choreography, so pay attention!

Take turns in completing the exercise, only one member at a time.
**Others should just watch, not doing anything on their own projects (this includes not even pulling changes!)** until they are instructed to.
If you feel like you will not be able to resist the urge to touch your computer when it is not your turn, we recommend putting your hands in your pockets or sitting on them!

**Before starting**: everyone should have the repo cloned and know which role number(s) they are.

**Role 1:**

-   Add the names of all team members next to `author` in the YAML.
-   Knit, commit, push.

🛑 Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Role 2:**

-   For the `author` in the YAML, type the team member names but in a different order.
-   Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.
-   Pull. Look at the document with the merge conflict.
-   Clear the merge conflict by editing the document to choose the correct/preferred change (ideally your team members!)
-   Knit.
-   **Click the Stage checkbox** for all files in your Git tab. Make sure they all have check marks, not filled-in boxes.
-   Commit and push.

🛑 Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Role 3:**

-   Change the chunk label `chunk1` to `load-data` as it is more informative about what the code in the chunk is doing.
-   Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.
-   Pull. No merge conflicts should occur, but you should see a message about merging.
-   Now push.

🛑 Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Role 4:**

-   Change the chunk label `chunk1` to `reading-nobel-data`.
-   Knit, commit, push. You should get an error.
-   Pull. Look at the document with the merge conflict. Clear the merge conflict by choosing the correct/preferred change. Commit, and push.

🛑 Make sure the previous role has finished before moving on to the next step.

**Everyone:** Pull, and observe the changes in your document.

## Tips for collaborating via GitHub

-   Always pull first before you start working.
-   Resolve a merge conflict (commit and push) *before* continuing your work. Never do new work while resolving a merge conflict.
-   Knit, commit, and push often to minimize merge conflicts and/or to make merge conflicts easier to resolve.
-   If you find yourself in a situation that is difficult to resolve, ask questions ASAP. Do not let it linger and get bigger.

# Getting started


## Packages

Before getting started with the Exercises, run the following code in the Console to load this package.

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data: Nobel laureates

The dataset for this assignment can be found as a csv file in the `data` folder of your repository.
You can read it in using the following.

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
nobel <- read_csv("data/nobel.csv")
```

The variable descriptions are as follows:

-   `id`: ID number
-   `firstname`: First name of laureate
-   `surname`: Surname
-   `year`: Year prize won
-   `category`: Category of prize
-   `affiliation`: Affiliation of laureate
-   `city`: City of laureate in prize year
-   `country`: Country of laureate in prize year
-   `born_date`: Birth date of laureate
-   `died_date`: Death date of laureate
-   `gender`: Gender of laureate
-   `born_city`: City where laureate was born
-   `born_country`: Country where laureate was born
-   `born_country_code`: Code of country where laureate was born
-   `died_city`: City where laureate died
-   `died_country`: Country where laureate died
-   `died_country_code`: Code of country where laureate died
-   `overall_motivation`: Overall motivation for recognition
-   `share`: Number of other winners award is shared with
-   `motivation`: Motivation for recognition

In a few cases the name of the city/country changed after the prize was given (e.g. in 1975 Bosnia and Herzegovina was called the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia).
In these cases the variables below reflect a different name than their counterparts without the suffix `_original`.

-   `born_country_original`: Original country where laureate was born
-   `born_city_original`: Original city where laureate was born
-   `died_country_original`: Original country where laureate died
-   `died_city_original`: Original city where laureate died
-   `city_original`: Original city where laureate lived at the time of winning the award
-   `country_original`: Original country where laureate lived at the time of winning the award

# Exercises

Take turns answering the exercises.

## Get to know your data

1.  How many observations and how many variables are in the dataset? Use inline code to answer this question. What does each row represent?

There are some observations in this dataset that we will exclude from our analysis to match the BuzzFeed News results.

2.  Create a new data frame called `nobel_living` that filters for

-   laureates for whom `country` is available
-   laureates who are people as opposed to organizations (organizations are denoted with `"org"` as their `gender`)
-   laureates who are still alive (their `died_date` is `NA`)

```{r echo=FALSE}
nobel_living <- nobel %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(country),
    gender != "org",
    is.na(died_date)
  )
```

Confirm that once you have filtered for these characteristics you are left with a data frame with `r nrow(nobel_living)` observations, once again using inline code.

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

## Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes

... says the BuzzFeed News article.
Let us see if that is true.

First, we will create a new variable to identify whether the laureate was in the US when they won their prize.
We will use the `mutate()` function for this.
The following pipeline mutates the `nobel_living` data frame by adding a new variable called `country_us`.
We use an *if* statement to create this variable.
The first argument in the `if_else()` function we're using to write this if statement is the condition we're testing for.
If `country` is equal to `"USA"`, we set `country_us` to `"USA"`.
If not, we set the `country_us` to `"Other"`.

```{marginfigure}
Note that we can achieve the same result using the `fct_other()` function we have seen before (i.e. with `country_us = fct_other(country, "USA")`). We decided to use the `if_else()` here to show you one example of an *if* statement in R.
```

```{r}
nobel_living <- nobel_living %>%
  mutate(
    country_us = if_else(country == "USA", "USA", "Other")
  )
```

Next, we will limit our analysis to only the following categories: Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, and Economics.

```{r}
nobel_living_science <- nobel_living %>%
  filter(category %in% c("Physics", "Medicine", "Chemistry", "Economics"))
```

For the next exercise work with the `nobel_living_science` data frame you created above.
This means you will need to define this data frame in your R Markdown document, even though the next exercise does not explicitly ask you to do so.

3.  Create a faceted bar plot visualizing the relationship between the category of prize and whether the laureate was in the US when they won the Nobel Prize.
    Interpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the BuzzFeed News headline is supported by the data.

    -   Your visualization should be faceted by category.
    -   For each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.
    -   Flip the coordinates so the bars are horizontal, not vertical.

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

## But of those US-based Nobel laureates, many were born in other countries

```{marginfigure}
**Hint:** You should be able to ~~cheat~~ borrow from code you used earlier to create the `country_us` variable.
```

4.  Create a new variable called `born_country_us` that has the value `"USA"` if the laureate is born in the US and `”Other `otherwise.
    How many of the winners are born in the US?

5.  Add a second variable to your visualization from Exercise 3 based on whether the laureate was born in the US or not.
    Based on your visualization, do the data appear to support BuzzFeed News's claim?
    Explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences.

    -   Your final visualization should contain a facet for each category.
    -   Within each facet, there should be a bar for whether the laureate won the award in the US or not.
    -   Each bar should have segments for whether the laureate was born in the US or not.

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

## "Here's where those immigrant Nobelists were born"

```{marginfigure}
Note that your bar plot won't exactly match the one from the BuzzFeed News article. This is likely because the data has been updated since the article was published.  Do not worry if you cannot make the bar plot have all the bars in decreasing order of size---but you might like to try anyway!
```

6.  In a single pipeline, filter for laureates who won their prize in the US, but were born outside of the US, and then create a frequency table (with the `count()` function) for their birth country (`born_country`) and arrange the resulting data frame in descending order of number of observations for each country. **Note that we are now no longer restricting to only the four science prizes.** Which country is the most common? Make a (horizontal) bar plot of the data.

```{marginfigure}
Hint: you will need to go back to the `nobel_living` data frame.  You may wish to use `mutate` again to recreate the `country_us` and `born_country_us` variables.
```

🧶 ✅ ⬆️ Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

Now go back through your write up to make sure you have answered all questions and all of your R chunks are properly labelled.

# Finishing off

Once you decide as a team that you are done with this lab, all members of the team should pull the changes and knit the R Markdown document to confirm that they can reproduce the report.

Team member 1 should now consider removing the other team members as collaborators to prevent them from making any further changes to your GitHub repository.

Team members 2+ should now take a clone of the lab worksheet from team member 1 so that you have your own personal copy of today's exercises.

# Interested in how BuzzFeed News made their visualizations?

The plots in the BuzzFeed News article are called waffle plots.
You can find the code used for making these plots in BuzzFeed News's GitHub repo (yes, they have one!) [here](https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2017-01-immigration-and-science/).
You are not expected to recreate them as part of your assignment, but you are welcomed to do so for fun!
