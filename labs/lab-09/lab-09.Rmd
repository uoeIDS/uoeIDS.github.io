This week you'll be working on your projects.

# Logistics

**Review evaluation criteria:** When evaluating your project, we will consider the following questions:

**Presentation (50 points)**

- Content: Is the research question well designed and are the data being used relevant to the research question?

- Statistical Knowledge: Did the team use appropriate plots and statistical procedures. Are results interpreted accurately?

- Slides: Are the slides well organised, readable, not full of text, featuring figures with legible labels, legends, etc.?

- Professionalism: How well did the team present? Does the presentation appear to be well practised? Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project? Did the team divide the time well among themselves or got cut off going over time?

- Teamwork: Did the team present a unified story, or did it seem like independent pieces of work patched together?

**Write-up (30 points)**

- Clarity of aim: The work’s aim is stated in a simple manner, questions are concrete and testable.

- Methodology: Accurately describes the data and use of data science techniques to meet the aim(s) of the project. Data science techniques chosen are appropriate. 

- Interpretation: Addresses the project questions or hypothesis, conclusions are supported by the data and results.

- Creativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does the project demonstrate originality of thought or approach?

- Concise/use of language: Is it concise but detailed enough (e.g. avoids repetition and wordiness)? Is it understandable for people not familiar with the data? Does it clearly communicate thoughts and concepts whilst utilizing an appropriate language and style?

**Reproducibility and Organization (10 points)**

- Repository Organisation: Are files well named and in sensible locations?

- Effort: Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project? (i.e. files in extra folder)

- Code style: Is the code easy to follow, does it have a consistent style? Is the code well organised with clear variables and function names?

- Reproduciblility/Replicability: Does the code appear to be able to be run by others (e.g. no specific paths like "/cloud/project"), will they get the same results (e.g. seed set?).

**Team peer evaluation (10 points)**

- You will need to complete an evaluation of the input of your teammates. This is to check that everyone contributed equally. Anyone judged to not have sufficiently contributed to the final product will have their grade penalised. 

# Project progress

Now back to your project...

1. **Craft your to-do list:** Discuss your plan for your project as a team, review existing issues and open new ones as needed. Not every issue needs to have a checklist, but you might want to include checklists in some of them to remind yourselves the exact steps you discussed to tackle the issue. Then assign **at least one** issue to each team member. 

2. **Cite your data:** Now is the time to fix up those citations! In your project summary there is a link to a resource for properly citing data. Develop a citation for your dataset and add it under the data section using this guidance. If you have questions, ask a tutor for help!

3. **Strongly recommended:** Get a hold of a tutor and run your ideas by them. Give them a 30 second version of your 5 minute presentation and ask for their feedback.
