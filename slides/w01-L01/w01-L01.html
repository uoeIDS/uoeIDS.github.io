## Data science

.pull-left-wide[
- Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

- We're going to learn to do this in a `tidy` way -- more on that later!

- This is a course on introduction to data science, with an emphasis on statistical thinking.

- In addition to writing code, we will start getting familiar with some statistical concepts.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**
A - While statistics `\(\ne\)` data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**
A - Yes.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**
A - R.

**Q: Why not language X?**
A: We can discuss that over tea/coffee ☕.

---

## Reading

.pull-left-wide[
- Reading material and videos available each week on the course website.

- This is split into required and optional material.

- The required material forms part of the course and might not be covered in lectures, so make sure you look over this before the workshop on Friday. ]


---

- **Deadline**: Fridays at 16:00, weeks 7 &amp; 10.
- Work on them individually.
- All two submissions count.
- Submit via Gradescope.
- **IMPORTANT:** Your GitHub repository _MUST_ be made private for individual homework assignments. Failure to make your repository private means that others can see your work and thereby risks incurring an academic misconduct case.


---

## Assessment

**Project** (60%)
- TL;DR: Find a dataset and do something with it! You will see some data suggestions later in the semester.
- Work in teams, ideally using pair programming techniques.
- How are you graded:
  - A 5 minute team presentation.
  - A write-up of your investigation, 1,500 word count.
- You must complete the project and participate in the presentation.
- More details will be provided later in the course.

---

## Collaboration policy

- Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.

- Individual assignments must be completed individually, you may not directly share or discuss answers / code with anyone other than the instructors and tutors.

- You are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

---

## Sharing / reusing code policy

- We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted.

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. Google, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).

- Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source.

---

## Use of Generative-AI in this course

Remember: 
- assignments should contain students’ own original work; 
- be aware of the limitations of generative AI and the dangers of relying on it as a source of information; 
- you need to acknowledge the use of generative AI where it is (permitted to be) used; 
  - ❗ presenting AI outputs as your own original work is considered as academic misconduct.

Please read the [University guidance on GenAI](https://information-services.ed.ac.uk/computing/comms-and-collab/elm/guidance-for-working-with-generative-ai).

---

## Use of Generative-AI in this course

Academic integrity is an underlying principle of research and academic practice. All submitted work is expected to be your own.

**In-class test**, **Homework** and **quizzes**:
- AI tools (e.g., chatGPT, ELM) should **not be used** for this assessment. Using AI without authorisation might constitute academic misconduct
- Please ensure that you do not input direct exercise questions into the AI prompts.

---

## Use of Generative-AI in this course

Academic integrity is an underlying principle of research and academic practice. All submitted work is expected to be your own.

**Final Project**:
- AI tools (e.g., chatGPT, ELM) should **not be used to generate content** for this assessment. However, you are allowed to use these tools to identify ideas, help organize your thoughts, and plan your assessment. 
- You may also use it to improve the clarity of your writing, but you should not use it in the final wording of your work. In particular, you should not copy-paste entire sentences produced by genAI. 
- For example, you may use genAI tools for learning purposes, to enhance your understanding and develop your skills independently, similar to how you would use search engines to research information, or as a virtual tutor. 
- **If you use AI software, you must acknowledge its use in your submission.** [Here you can find examples of acknowledgements](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/academic-skills-kit/good-academic-practice/artificial-intelligence/acknowledging/) (no need to list the prompts and outputs used).


---

## Getting help

- **Piazza** for course content, logistics, etc. discussion on the course discussion forum

- **Student hour (Q&amp;A session)** after Wednesday lecture at 12.10-13.00, JCMB 5326. Optional, drop-in if you have any questions.

- **MathsBase** for drop-in support from a tutor

- ~~Email~~ **Piazza private messages**: for questions _only_ about personal matters (e.g. illness, concessions).

- Most importantly, ask questions!
