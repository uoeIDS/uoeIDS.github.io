# Case Study: Amazon's hiring algorithm

---

## Amazon's experimental hiring algorithm

- Used AI to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars -- much like shoppers rate products on Amazon
- Amazon's system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way; it taught itself that male candidates were preferable

.pull-left-wide[
>Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models’ judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said.

## Modelling questions

.pull-left[

```{r echo = FALSE}
df <- tibble(x = c(0.491, 0.833, 0.758, 0.902, 0.278, 0.446, 0.272, 0.33, 0.864, 0.11),
             y = c(0.466, 0.817, 0.696, 0.992, 0.179, 0.531, 0.353, 0.283, 0.948, 0.209))
df_new <- tibble(x = seq(0,1,by=0.01))
M1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = df)
M2 <- lm(y ~ poly(x, 7), data = df)
df_new$y_M1 <- predict(M1,newdata = df_new)
df_new$y_M2 <- predict(M2,newdata = df_new)

  labs(x = "x", y = "y") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,1), ylim = c(0, 1)) 
```


]
.pull-right[

Fit accuracy (residual sum of squares):
* Model 1: `r sum((predict(M1)-df$y)^2)`
* Model 2: `r sum((predict(M2)-df$y)^2)`

.question[
Q1: Which model gives a better fit to the data?
]


.question[
Q2: From the data, suggest what is a reasonable $y$ value when $x=0.625$?

## ProPublica analysis

### **Data:**

Risk scores assigned to more than 7,000 people arrested in Broward County, Florida, in 2013 and 2014 + whether they were charged with new crimes over the next two years

---

## ProPublica analysis

### **Results:**

- 20% of those predicted to commit violent crimes actually did
- Algorithm had higher accuracy (61%) when full range of crimes taken into account (e.g. misdemeanors)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/propublica-results.png")
```
- Algorithm was more likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, at almost twice the rate as white defendants
- White defendants were mislabelled as low risk more often than black defendants

# Recommendations - "The Algorithm"

---

## Netflix recommendation algorithm

How Netflix's Recommendations System Works - [Source](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/100639).
* Optionally 'jump start' with your own preferences
* Preferences will be superseded once you start watching titles
* Update to recommendations includes information from:
  - your interaction with Netflix (history, ratings, etc.)
  - other members with similar tastes/preferences
  - information about titles (year, performers, genre, category)
* Also account for other factors: time of day, device, attention duration, etc.
* "... using algorithms and complex systems to provide a personalized experience."
* "We take feedback from very visit ... and continually re-train our algorithms"

# Understanding its purpose


---

## Chat-GPT


* ChatGPT is a language model

* Designed for generating human-like text in response to user input

* A powerful tool for automating text generation and answering a wide range of questions and prompts.

* Trained on a large corpus of text and can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

## Case Study: Mata vs Avianca Airline

* Roberto Mata sues airline for injury from metal serving cart.
* Lawyers for Mr Mata submit a document citing many 'relevant' court decision for their case.
* Neither judge or airline's lawyers were familiar with cases and sought copies of case notes.
* Mr Mata lawyers replied stating that they cannot locate requested case notes.

--

The initial document was generated by Chat-GPT, which **fabricated the references!**
* Judge: "... Do you cite cases without reading them?"
* Lawyer: "No."
* Judge: "What cause your departure here?"
* Lawyer: "I thought Chat-GPT was a search engine."

## Parting thoughts

- At some point during your data science learning journey you will learn tools that can be used unethically

- You might also be tempted to use your knowledge in a way that is ethically questionable either because of business goals or for the pursuit of further knowledge (or because your boss told you to do so)

.question[
How do you train yourself to make the right decisions (or reduce the likelihood of accidentally making the wrong decisions) at those points?
