## Reminders

- Check your html file knits and loads properly

--

- HDMI port on laptop, if you need converter let us know

--

- Don't forget your peer evaluation form

--

- Don't forget to add the course GitHub page to your project

<!-- -- -->

<!-- - Try to complete each requirement step by step and do submission on time to avoid extra stress! -->

<!-- --- -->
<!-- ## Topics for today -->

<!-- - Recap - what did people find difficult? -->

<!-- - Where can you go for more information? -->

<!-- - Next steps in R -->

<!-- - What else for Data Science? -->

## Report Structure

- **Introduction** – What is your data? What is the research question(s) you are investigating? Is there any relevant background information/literature that can help give context to your data/questions?
  
--
  
- **Methods** – Summarise what cleaning/pre-processing you have done to your data. Brief description of data science techniques you have used in your investigation.

--
  
- **Results** – Tables, figures and summary values from your exploratory investigation. Summary of a fitted statistical model, such as estimates, plots and fit statistics. A brief explanation of what the results mean in the given context of your data.

--
  
- **Discussion** –  What are the advantages/limitations of the investigation you have performed? If applicable, are there any ethical considerations in relation to your investigation/findings? If you had more time, what would you have done?
  
---
  
## Write-up tips
  
  - Be clear. Minimise jargon, make sure explanations are clear. Get someone else in your team to read and edit your text. 

- Use a consistent font, size, and heading style. This enhances readability and gives your report a professional look.

- Use a consistent citation style throughout your report. This adds credibility and allows readers to verify your sources.

- Do a good job on the basics rather than trying to do everything. Remember you only have 1,500 words. 

- No penalty will be applied if the report has up to 10% extra words (no penalty if word count < 1650)

---

## About Submission
  
- Submission done on Gradescope for report and slides: `final-project`. 

- Submit both  the `.html` file for your report and the `.html` file for your presentation slides.
- Only **one person per team** needs to complete this.
- This person needs to add their group members to the submission using the drop down list.

--
  
- Peer evaluation is via `WebPA` (in Learn > Assessment > WebPA). 

- **Everyone** needs to complete this.
- If you do not complete this peer feedback for all members of your team, you will receive a penalty of 20% off your mark.

---
  
## Logistics
  
- Make sure you include a link to your GitHub repo within the report, and add the course GitHub account to the repo. 

--
- In your report `.Rmd` file, change the `author:` field to include both: **your names** & **your group number**
  
```{md, eval=FALSE}
author: by TeamGoT (group number 8): Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Daenerys Targaryen, Tyrion Lannister
```

--
  - In the `README.md` file in your project repository, please add a section with the name, student ID and Github username of each team member, such as 

```{md, eval=FALSE}
## Team members

- Jon Snow (s1234567), johnsnow123
- Arya Stark (s1122334), thefaceless
- Daenerys Targaryen (s4433221), dragon_queen
- Tyrion Lannister (s1111111), t.lannister
```

<!-- --- --->

<!-- class:middle  --->

<!-- ## IDS overall reflection --->

<!-- (hopefully) Positive impacts --->

<!--   - You worked on generally the basics of data science pipeline in R language --->
<!--   - Getting familiar with main steps of data analysis in general --->
<!--   - IDS can be a good starting point for your personal further interest in Data Science --->

<!-- (Can be) Limited  --->

<!--   - Not so much space for statistical terms and methods (definitely will learn more later)  --->
<!--   - Maybe some re-ordering of the weekly topics can be discussed --->
<!--   - Further details on modeling part is a must (you will learn later) --->

<!-- What do you want to add ? --->
<!-- - Please fill out end-of-semester feedback!  --->

## R capabilities: Special case

---

## Shiny Apps

.pull-left[
- Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R
- You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards
- You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions
- Learn more at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/shiny.png")
```
]

---

## High level view

- Every Shiny app has a webpage that the user visits, and behind this webpage there is a computer that serves this webpage by running R

- When running your app locally, the computer serving your app is your computer

- When your app is deployed, the computer serving your app is a web server

- If you want to try making your own, try working through the reading [here](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html)

---

## Some others

- Dynamic reporting with Rmd files with different programming language

- Widely considered the best tool for making beautiful graphs and visualizations. 

- Possible to find advanced statistics packages for high-level modeling.

--

**Key message**: If you learn a programming language to some extent, you can learn other tools intuitively  even if there are some differences on syntax. The battle of R vs Python is already over!
