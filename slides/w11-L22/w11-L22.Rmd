## IDS overall reflection

(hopefully) Positive impacts

  - You worked on generally the basics of data science pipeline in R language
  - Getting familiar with main steps of data analysis in general
  - IDS can be a good starting point for your personal further interest in Data Science

(Can be) Limited 

  - Not so much space for statistical terms and methods (definitely will learn more later) 
  - Maybe some re-ordering of the weekly topics can be discussed
  - Further details on modeling part is a must (you will learn later)

What do you want to add ?
- Connect to Wooclap using code **SJTGNO**

## Looking Beyond IDS

---

## Books - I


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", fig.cap="  "}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/IMS.png", "img/R4DS.jpeg", "img/AdvancedR.png"))
```

---

## Books - II


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="25%", fig.show='hold', fig.align="center", fig.cap="  "}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/StatLiteracy.jpeg", "img/ArtofStats.jpg", "img/StatswithoutTears.jpg"))
```

## R capabilities: Special case

---

## Shiny Apps

.pull-left[
- Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R
- You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards
- You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions
- Learn more at [shiny.rstudio.com](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/shiny.png")
```
]

---

## High level view

- Every Shiny app has a webpage that the user visits, and behind this webpage there is a computer that serves this webpage by running R

- When running your app locally, the computer serving your app is your computer

- When your app is deployed, the computer serving your app is a web server

- If you want to try making your own, try working through the reading [here](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-app.html)

---

## Some others

- Dynamic reporting with Rmd files with different programming language

- Widely considered the best tool for making beautiful graphs and visualizations. 

- Possible to find advanced statistics packages for high-level modeling.

--

**Key message**: If you learn a programming language to some extent, you can learn other tools intuitively  even if there are some differences on syntax. The battle of R vs Python is already over!
