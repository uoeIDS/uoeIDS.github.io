## Modelling

- Use models to explain the relationship between variables and to make predictions
- For now we will focus on **linear** models (but remember there are *many* *many* other types of models too!)

Two paintings very rich in composition, of a beautiful execution, and whose merit is very remarkable, each 17 inches 3 lines high, 23 inches wide; the first, painted on wood, comes from the Cabinet of Madame la Comtesse de Verrue; it represents a departure for the hunt: it shows in the front a child on a white horse, a man who gives the horn to gather the dogs, a falconer and other figures nicely distributed across the width of the painting; two horses drinking from a fountain; on the right in the corner a lovely country house topped by a terrace, on which people are at the table, others who play instruments; trees and fabriques pleasantly enrich the background.

# Modeling the relationship between variables

---

## Models as functions

- We can represent relationships between variables using **functions**
- A function is a mathematical concept: the relationship between an output and one or more inputs
  - Plug in the inputs and receive back the output
  - Example: The formula $y = 3x + 7$ is a function with input $x$ and output $y$. If $x$ is $5$, $y$ is $22$, $y = 3 \times 5 + 7 = 22$

## Vocabulary

- **Response variable:** Variable whose behavior or variation you are trying to understand, on the y-axis

--
- **Explanatory variables:** Other variables that you want to use to explain the variation in the response, on the x-axis

---

## Vocabulary (..continued)

- **Predicted value:** Output of the **model function**
  - The model function gives the typical (expected) value of the response variable *conditioning* on the explanatory variables
  
```{r height-width-plot-02,echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
ht_wt_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)

  ) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = .fitted), color = "#E48957")
```


---

## Vocabulary (..continued)

- **Residuals:** A measure of how far each case is from its predicted value (based on a particular model)
  - Residual = Observed value - Predicted value
  - Tells how far above/below the expected value each case is

```{r height-width-plot-03,echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot(data = ht_wt_fit_aug,

## Models - upsides and downsides

- Models can sometimes reveal patterns that are not evident in a graph of the data. This is a great advantage of modeling over simple visual inspection of data. 
- There is a real risk, however, that a model is imposing structure that is not really there on the scatter plot of the data, just as people imagine animal shapes in the stars. A skeptical approach is always warranted.

---

## Variation around the model...

is just as important as the model, if not more!  

*Statistics is the explanation of variation in the context of what remains unexplained.*

- The scatter plot of the residuals suggests that there might be other factors that account for large parts of painting-to-painting variability, or perhaps just that randomness plays a big role.
- Adding more explanatory variables to a model can sometimes usefully reduce the size of the scatter plot of the residuals around the predicted values. (We'll talk more about this later.)

## Paris Paintings: Predict height from width

Linear model with one predictor: $$\widehat{height}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times width_{i}$$

```{r height-width-plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = Width_in, y = Height_in)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#8E2C90") + 
  labs(
    title = "Height vs. width of paintings",
    subtitle = "Paris auctions, 1764 - 1780",
    x = "Width (inches)",
    y = "Height (inches)"
  )
```


---

```{r chunk31, out.width="98%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidymodels.png")
```


---

## Step 1: Specify model

```{r}
linear_reg()
```

---

## Step 2: Set model fitting *engine*

```{r}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") # lm: linear model
```

---

## Step 3: Fit model & estimate parameters

... using **formula syntax**

```{r fit-model}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)
```

---

## A closer look at model output

```{r chunk34, ref.label="fit-model", echo=FALSE}
```

.large[
$$\widehat{height}_{i} = 3.6214 + 0.7808 \times width_{i}$$
]

---

## A tidy look at model output

```{r}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp) %>%
  tidy()
```

.large[
$$\widehat{height}_{i} = 3.62 + 0.781 \times width_{i}$$
]

---

## Interpretation: slope and intercept

.large[
$$\widehat{height}_{i} = 3.62 + 0.781 \times width_{i}$$
]

--

- **Slope:** For each additional inch the painting is wider, the height is *expected* to be higher, *on average*, by 0.781 inches.

--
- **Intercept:** Paintings that are 0 inches wide are *expected* to be 3.62 inches high, *on average*. (Does this make sense?)

---

## Correlation does not imply causation

Remember this when interpreting model coefficients

```{r chunk35, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}

```

# Parameter estimation

---

## Linear model with a single predictor

- We're interested in $\beta_0$ (population parameter for the intercept) and $\beta_1$ (population parameter for the slope) in the following model:

$$\hat{y}_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1~x_{i}$$

--
- Tough luck, you can't have them...

--
- So we use sample statistics to estimate them:

$$\hat{y}_{i} = b_0 + b_1~x_{i}$$

---

## Least squares regression

- The regression line minimizes the sum of squared residuals.

--
- If $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$, then, the regression line minimizes 
$\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i^2$.

---

## Visualizing residuals

```{r vis-res-1, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
ht_wt_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)

ht_wt_fit_tidy <- tidy(ht_wt_fit$fit) 
ht_wt_fit_aug  <- augment(ht_wt_fit$fit) %>%
  mutate(res_cat = ifelse(.resid > 0, TRUE, FALSE))

p <- ggplot(data = ht_wt_fit_aug, 
            aes(x = Width_in, y = Height_in)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  labs(
    title = "Height vs. width of paintings",
    subtitle = "Just the data",
    x = "Width (inches)",
    y = "Height (inches)"
    ) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 250), ylim = c(0, 200)) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(colour = "#E48957", face = "bold", size = rel(1.5)))
p
```

---

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r vis-res-2, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
p <- p + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#8E2C90", se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = .fitted), color = "#E48957") +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares line")
p
```

---

## Visualizing residuals (cont.)

```{r vis-res-3, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
p + 
  geom_segment(mapping = aes(xend = Width_in, yend = .fitted), color = "#E48957", alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(subtitle = "Data + least squares line + residuals")
```

---

## Properties of least squares regression

- The regression line goes through the center of mass point, the coordinates corresponding to average $x$ and average $y$, $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$:  

$$\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \bar{x} ~ \rightarrow ~ b_0 = \bar{y} - b_1 \bar{x}$$

--
- The slope has the same sign as the correlation coefficient: $b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$

--
- The sum of the residuals is zero: $\sum_{i = 1}^n e_i = 0$

--
- The residuals and $x$ values are uncorrelated

# Models with categorical explanatory variables

## Height & landscape features

```{r ht-lands-fit}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Height_in ~ factor(landsALL), data = pp) %>%
  tidy()
```

---

## Height & landscape features

$$\widehat{Height_{in}} = 22.7 - 5.645~landsALL$$

- **Slope:** Paintings with landscape features are expected, on average, to be 5.645 inches shorter than paintings that without landscape features
  - Compares baseline level (`landsALL = 0`) to the other level (`landsALL = 1`)
    
- **Intercept:** Paintings that don't have landscape features are expected, on average, to be 22.7 inches tall

---

## Relationship between height and school

```{r ht-school, output.lines=10}

```

---

## Dummy variables

```{r chunk50, ref.label="ht-school", echo = FALSE}
```

- When the categorical explanatory variable has many levels, they're encoded to **dummy variables**
- Each coefficient describes the expected difference between heights in that particular school compared to the baseline level

## Recap: How do we use models?

- Explanation: Characterize the relationship between $y$ and $x$ via 
  
  - *slopes* for numerical explanatory variables or 
  
  - *differences* for categorical explanatory variables
  
  
- Prediction: Plug in $x$, get the predicted $y$
