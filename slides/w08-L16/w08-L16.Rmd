# Model checking

---

## "Linear" models

- We're fitting a "linear" model, which assumes a linear relationship between our explanatory and response variables.
- But how do we assess this?

---

## Data: Paris Paintings

```{r message=FALSE}
pp <- read_csv("data/paris-paintings.csv", na = c("n/a", "", "NA"))
```

- Number of observations: `r nrow(pp)`
- Number of variables: `r ncol(pp)`

---

## Graphical diagnostic: residuals plot

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "residuals-plot", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}

```{r residuals-plot, fig.show="hide"}
ht_wt_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(Height_in ~ Width_in, data = pp)

ht_wt_fit_aug <- augment(ht_wt_fit$fit) #<<

ggplot(ht_wt_fit_aug, mapping = aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "gray", lty = "dashed") +

## Transforming the data

- We saw that `price` has a right-skewed distribution, and the relationship between price and width of painting is non-linear.

--
- In these situations a transformation applied to the response variable may be useful.

--
- In order to decide which transformation to use, we should examine the distribution of the response variable.

--
- The extremely right skewed distribution suggests that a log transformation may 
be useful.
    - log = natural log, $ln$
    - Default base of the `log` function in R is the natural log: <br>
    `log(x, base = exp(1))`
    
---

## Logged price vs. width

.question[
How do we interpret the slope of this model?
]

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data = pp_wt_lt_100, mapping = aes(x = Width_in, y = log(price))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#8E2C90", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Width (in)", y = "Log(price) (log livres)")
```

---

## Models with log transformation

```{r}
linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(log(price) ~ Width_in, data = pp_wt_lt_100) %>%
  tidy()
```

---


## Interpreting the slope

$$ \widehat{log(price)} = 4.67 + 0.0192 \times Width $$

- For each additional inch the painting is wider, the log price of the painting is expected to be higher, on average, by 0.0192 log livres.

--
- which is not a very useful statement...

Instead:

- For each additional inch the painting is wider, the price of the painting is expected to be higher, on average, *by a (multiplicative) factor of 1.0192* (1.0192 = exp(0.0192)).


--

In other words:

- For each additional inch the painting is wider, the price of the painting is expected to be higher, on average, *by 1.92%* (1.92 = 100 * 0.0192).

---

## Transform, or learn more?

- Data transformations may also be useful when the relationship is non-linear
- However in those cases a polynomial regression may be more appropriate
  + This is beyond the scope of this course, but you’re welcomed to try it for your final project, and I’d be happy to provide further guidance

## Parallel slopes

By adding the **main effect** for `cover` we obtained to parallel lines for each group.

```{r out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(book_main_fit_aug, 
             mapping = aes(x = volume, y = weight, color = cover), size = 3) +
  geom_line(book_main_fit_aug, 
          mapping = aes(x = volume, y = .fitted, color = cover), linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Main effects, parallel slopes", 
       subtitle = "weight-hat = volume + cover") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#071381"))
```

Can we fit a model so that the fitted lines for the two categories of `cover` are 
not parallel, 
or in other words, have a different slope?

---

## Two ways to model

- **Main effects:** Assuming relationship between volume and weight 
**does not vary** by whether the cover is hardback or paperback.
- **Interaction effects:** Assuming relationship between volume and weight 
**varies** by whether the cover is hardback or paperback.

---

## Interacting explanatory variables

- Including an interaction effect in the model allows for different slopes, i.e. 
nonparallel lines.
- This implies that the regression coefficient for an explanatory variable would 
change as another explanatory variable changes.
- This can be accomplished by adding an interaction variable: the product of two 
explanatory variables.

In this example, the difference is small. 
Let's look at another example.

## Price, surface area, and living artist

- Explore the relationship between price of paintings and surface area, conditioned 
on whether or not the artist is still living
- First visualize and explore, then model

```{r echo=FALSE}
pp <- pp %>%
  mutate(artistliving = if_else(artistliving == 0, "Deceased", "Living"))
```

---

## Typical surface area

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
.pull-left-narrow[
Typical surface area appears to be less than 1000 square inches (~ 80cm x 80cm). 

There are very few paintings that have surface area above 5000 square inches.
]
.pull-right-wide[
```{r ref.label = "viz-surf-artistliving", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
```
]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r viz-surf-artistliving, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(data = pp, aes(x = Surface, fill = artistliving)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) + 
  facet_grid(artistliving ~ .) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#071381")) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Surface area", y = NULL) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1000) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 5000, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray")
```
]
]

---

## Narrowing the scope

For simplicity let's focus on the paintings with `Surface < 5000`:
.midi[
```{r surf-lt-5000}
pp_Surf_lt_5000 <- pp %>%
  filter(Surface < 5000)
```
]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label = "viz-surf-lt-5000-artistliving", echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
```

]
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r viz-surf-lt-5000-artistliving, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(data = pp_Surf_lt_5000, 
       aes(y = log_price, x = Surface, color = artistliving, shape = artistliving)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~artistliving) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E48957", "#071381")) +
  labs(color = "Artist", shape = "Artist")
```
]
]

## Fit model with main effects

- Response variable: `log_price`
- Explanatory variables: `Surface` area and `artistliving`

.midi[
```{r model-main-effects}
pp_main_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(log_price ~ Surface + artistliving, data = pp_Surf_lt_5000)
tidy(pp_main_fit)
```
]

--

$$\widehat{log\_price} = 4.88 + 0.000265 \times surface + 0.137 \times artistliving$$

---

## Solving the model

$$\widehat{log\_price} = 4.88 + 0.000265 \times surface + 0.137 \times artistliving$$

- Non-living artist: Plug in 0 for `artistliving`

\begin{align}
\widehat{log\_price} =& \color{#E48957}{4.88} + 0.000265 \times surface + \color{#E48957}{0.137 \times 0}\\
=& (\color{#E48957}{4.88+0}) + 0.000265 \times surface\\
=& \color{#E48957}{4.88} + 0.000265 \times surface
\end{align}

--
- Living artist: Plug in 1 for `artistliving`

\begin{align}
\widehat{log\_price} =& \color{#2AA3BB}{4.88} + 0.000265 \times surface + \color{#2AA3BB}{0.137 \times 1}\\
=& (\color{#2AA3BB}{4.88+0.137}) + 0.000265 \times surface\\
=& \color{#2AA3BB}{5.017} + 0.000265 \times surface
\end{align}

---

## Visualizing main effects

.pull-left-narrow[
- **Same slope:** Rate of change in price as the surface area increases does
not vary between paintings by living and non-living artists.
- **Different intercept:** Paintings by living artists are consistently more
expensive than paintings by non-living artists.

## Interpretation of interaction effects

- Rate of change in price as the surface area of the painting increases does
vary between paintings by living and non-living artists (different slopes),
- Some paintings by living artists are more expensive than paintings by
non-living artists, and some are not (different intercept).

## In pursuit of Occam's razor

- Occam's Razor states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

--
- Model selection follows this principle.

--
- We only want to add another variable to the model if the addition of that variable brings something valuable in terms of predictive power to the model.

--
- In other words, we prefer the simplest best model, i.e. **parsimonious** model.

## R-squared

$R^2$ is the percentage of variability in the response variable explained by 
the regression model.

```{r}
glance(book_main_fit)$r.squared
glance(book_int_fit)$r.squared
```

--
- Clearly the model with interactions has a higher $R^2$.

--
- However using $R^2$ for model selection in models with multiple explanatory variables is not a good idea as $R^2$ increases when **any** variable is added to the model.

---

## Adjusted R-squared

... a (more) objective measure for model selection

- Adjusted $R^2$ doesn't increase if the new variable does not provide any new 
informaton or is completely unrelated, as it applies a penalty for number of 
variables included in the model.
- This makes adjusted $R^2$ a preferable metric for model selection in multiple
regression models.

--

It appears that adding the interaction actually increased adjusted $R^2$, so we
should indeed use the model with the interactions.

## Third order interactions

- Can you? Yes
- Should you? Probably not if you want to interpret these interactions in context
of the data.

## Recap

- The plot of residuals vs predicted/fitted values can be used as diagnostic plot.

--

- Transformations might help, and $\log(y)$ is useful when the response is right skewed and 
for variance stabilization.

  - In this case, the interpretation of the coefficients uses percentage change.

--

- We learnt how to fit and interpret models with multiple predictors

- When working with categorical predictors, main effects mean parallel lines, while interaction effects mean different slopes.

--

- We learnt about Occam's razor and how to use adjusted $R^2$ to do model comparison.
