## Principles	for	effective	visualizations

- Order matters
- Put long categories on the y-axis
- Keep	scales consistent
- Select meaningful colors
- Use meaningful and nonredundant labels

## Data

In September 2019, YouGov survey asked 1,639 GB adults the following question:

.pull-left[
> In hindsight, do you think Britain was right/wrong to vote to leave EU?
>
>- Right to leave  
>- Wrong to leave  
>- Don't know

]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE}

# Order matters

---

## Alphabetical order is rarely ideal

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="default-opinion", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r default-opinion, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(x = opinion)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

## Order by frequency

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="infreq", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

`fct_infreq`: Reorder factors' levels by frequency

```{r infreq, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(x = fct_infreq(opinion))) + #<<
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

## Clean up labels

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="labels", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r labels, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(x = opinion)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs( #<<
    x = "Opinion", #<<
    y = "Count" #<<
  ) #<<
```
]

]

---

## Alphabetical order is rarely ideal

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="region-default", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r region-default, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(x = region)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

## Use inherent level order

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Relevel]

`fct_relevel`: Reorder factor levels using a custom order

```{r relevel, fig.show = "hide"}
brexit <- brexit %>%
  mutate(
    region = fct_relevel( #<<
      region,
      "london", "rest_of_south", "midlands_wales", "north", "scot"
    )
  )
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(brexit, aes(x = region)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

## Clean up labels

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Recode]

`fct_recode`: Change factor levels by hand

```{r recode, fig.show = "hide"}
brexit <- brexit %>%
  mutate(
    region = fct_recode( #<<
      region,
      London = "london",
      `Rest of South` = "rest_of_south",
      `Midlands / Wales` = "midlands_wales",
      North = "north",
      Scotland = "scot"
    )
  )
```
]

```{r recode-plot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(brexit, aes(x = region)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

class: middle

# Put long categories on the y-axis

---

## Long categories can be hard to read

```{r ref.label="recode-plot", echo = FALSE}
```

---

## Move them to the y-axis

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="flip", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r flip, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(y = region)) + #<<
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

## And reverse the order of levels

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="rev", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

`fct_rev`: Reverse order of factor levels

```{r rev, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(y = fct_rev(region))) + #<<
  geom_bar()
```
]

]

---

## Clean up labels

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r labels-again, fig.show = "hide"}

  labs( #<<
    x = "Count", #<<
    y = "Region" #<<

## Segmented bar plots can be hard to read

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="segment", echo = FALSE}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r segment, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(y = region, fill = opinion)) + #<<
  geom_bar()
```

---

## Use facets

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="facet", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r facet, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(y = opinion, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow = 1) #<<
```
]

]

---

## Avoid redundancy?

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(y = opinion)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow = 1)
```

---

## Redundancy can help tell a story

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="facet-fill", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}
```

ggplot(brexit, aes(y = opinion, fill = opinion)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow = 1)
```
]

]

---

## Be selective with redundancy

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="hide-legend", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow = 1) +
  guides(fill = "none") #<<
```
]

]

---

## Use informative labels

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="informative-label", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Code]

```{r informative-label, fig.show = "hide"}
ggplot(brexit, aes(y = opinion, fill = opinion)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~region, nrow = 1) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Was Britain right/wrong to vote to leave EU?", #<<
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  )
```
]

]

---

## A bit more info

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="more-info", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}
```
]

## Let's do better

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Plot]
```{r ref.label="short-link", echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.45, out.width = "90%"}

## Scientific studies

.pull-left[
**Observational**  
- Collect data in a way that does not interfere with how the data arise ("observe")
- Establish associations
]
.pull-right[
**Experimental**  
- Randomly assign subjects to treatments
- Establish causal connections

.question[
What type of study is the following, observational or experiment? What does that mean in terms of causal conclusions?

*Researchers studying the relationship between exercising and energy levels asked participants in their study how many times a week they exercise and whether they have high or low energy when they wake up in the morning.*

*Based on responses to the exercise question the researchers grouped people into three categories (no exercise, exercise 1-3 times a week, and exercise more than 3 times a week).* 

*The researchers then compared the proportions of people who said they have high energy in the mornings across the three exercise categories.*

# Case study: Breakfast cereal keeps girls slim

> *Girls who ate breakfast of any type had a lower average body mass index (BMI), a common obesity gauge, than those who said they didn't. The index was even lower for girls who said they ate cereal for breakfast, according to findings of the study conducted by the Maryland Medical Research Institute with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and cereal-maker General Mills.* [...]

## Explanatory and response variables

- Explanatory variable: Whether the participant ate breakfast or not

- Reponse variable: BMI of the participant


---

## Three possible explanations

--

1. Eating breakfast causes girls to be slimmer 


--
2. Being slim causes girls to eat breakfast


--
3. A third variable is responsible for both -- a **confounding** variable: an extraneous variable that affects both the explanatory and the response variable, and that makes it seem like there is a relationship between them

## Conditional probability

**Notation**: $P(A | B)$: Probability of event A given event B

- What is the probability that it will be unseasonably warm tomorrow?
- What is the probability that it will be unseasonably warm tomorrow, given that it was unseasonably warm today?

---

## Independence

- If knowing event A happened tells you something about event B happening, or vice versa, then events A and B are not independent

- If not, they are said to be independent

- $P(A | B) = P(A)$
